•           Does the NBA receive or spend more money than the WNBA? (Sales, Marketing, player salaries)

•           Does the NBA have more viewership or attendance than the WNBA? Does the NBA have better timeslots?

•           Does the NBA have better sponsorship than the WNBA? Does team ownership have an impact on the leagues?

•           Who are the highest and lowest paid players in the NBA and WNBA? Are there any notable differences between the players?

•           Are there differences between contracts in the NBA and the WNBA?

## Project Intro


## Data Pre-Processing/Gathering Steps
Much of the NBA data was found on the NBA official website, ESPN, or the team websites, however information was much harder to find for the WNBA so many of us collected our own data from other sources.

### Player Stats
Infromation on player statistics for NBA & WNBA teams were gathered from NBA.com and WNBA.com. We created datasets using the statistics from 2019-2023 of 10 teams and their starting 5 or their 5 best players. Teams were decided by cities with both NBA and WNBA teams. Datasets were then cleaned and reorganized based apon different avenues of how we wanted to analyze the data. 

### Sales/Marketing
Information for sales and marketing were not publicly available and easily accessible. We generated the data by finding sources that expressed the revenues and marketing of both the NBA and WNBA. Limited amount of information about those were available online so we worked with what little data we could find. Created our own datasets and then manipulated the data to analyze. 


### Viewership/Attendance
Information on the average attendance for NBA home games and away games are organized on the ESPN website, so a dataset was created using those numbers. Since that does not exist for the WNBA, attendance numbers were pulled from the game notes of individual teams' websites (hosted by the WNBA website). Not all teams provide game notes, and not all of those notes provide the same information, so the resulting dataset wasn't as complete as the NBA data.

Since the datasets were not formed by an outside party, there was very little cleaning to do, however rows were sometimes dropped if they did not contain pertinent information.

### Sponsorship
Sponsorship information for NBA and WNBA teams is focused on the sponsorship gained from arena naming rights to more easily quantify the data. Because this information is not readily available to the public from a single source, a dataset was created for the data gathered across multiple sites. Not all sites contained the amount paid for the sponsorships, or were missing parts of other relevant data pertaining to the sponsorship in question. This made the resulting dataset not as complete as it could be if the information was readily available.

Since the datasets were formed by a outside party, much cleaning had to be done. However, rows were still dropped due to the aformentioned missing data.
